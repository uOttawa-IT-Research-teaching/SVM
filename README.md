# SVM

This machine learning training explores the power and versatility of Support Vector Machines (SVMs), a class of models that employ mathematical optimization to find maximum margin hyperplanes for classification. While SVMs are considered optimal statistical learners, some of their mechanisms like kernels have been conceptually linked to emulating heuristic policies. This training provides a robust understanding of SVMs and their applications in various classification tasks. This tutorial will encompass an overview of the learning objectives, a dedicated section detailing the prerequisites for completing the tutorial, and a guide on best practices for Research Data Management (RDM).

The training comprises four notebooks: Regularization, Kernels, Deeper Understanding, and Noise Reduction. The first notebook, Regularization, delves into SVMs, focusing on maximizing the margin to achieve robust classification performance. The second notebook, Kernels, introduces kernel functions that transform non-linear problems into linearly separable ones, enhancing classifier accuracy. The third notebook, A Deeper Understanding, explores how diverse kernel functions in SVM classifiers affect decision boundaries and margins, offering practical insights beyond mathematical analysis.
The fourth notebook, Noise_Red_Reduction, focuses on addressing noise and variance in data, essential challenges in real-world systems. It explores how Random Forests employ ensemble modeling to reduce overfitting in SVM models. By averaging probabilistic predictions from an ensemble of SVM classifiers, Random Forests mitigate variance and enhance model performance. This training, therefore, offers insights into ensemble learning techniques and the synergy between SVM and Random Forest classifiers in handling noisy data.
