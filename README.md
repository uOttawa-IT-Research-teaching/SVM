# SVM
Support vector machines (SVMs) are powerful machine learning models that employ mathematical optimization to find maximum margin hyperplanes for classification. While SVMs are considered optimal statistical learners, some of their mechanisms like kernels have been conceptually linked to emulating heuristic policies. In a new paper soon to be published, we formally investigate whether SVMs can exhibit both optimal and heuristic classification behaviours, drawing parallels to dual-process psychology models like Kahneman and Tverskyâ€™s System 1 and System 2 thinking. Through theoretical analysis and experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, we characterize conditions under which SVMs simulate heuristic judgments, including effects of non-linear kernels, training data properties, model complexity, and more. Our study reveals intriguing similarities between human and machine classification policies, despite their fundamentally different learning processes. We discuss implications for interpreting modern AI through cognitive psychology lenses while identifying key differences. This multidisciplinary work aims to provide novel empirical insights on the interplay between heuristic and optimal policies in an important class of machine learning algorithms. The results shed light on developing human-aligned classifiers that balance the strengths of both System 1 and System 2 thinking.
